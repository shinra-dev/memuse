\usage{
howmany(
  x,
  nrow,
  ncol,
  out.type = "full",
  representation = "dense",
  ...,
  sparsity = 0.05,
  type = "double",
  intsize = 4,
  names = "short"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The size of a matrix stored as a \code{memuse} class object.}

\item{nrow, ncol}{Number of (global) rows/columns of the matrix.}

\item{out.type}{If the full dimensions or a reduced representation should be
returned (see Details section below). Options are "full" and "approximate"
(with partial matching).}

\item{representation}{The kind of storage the object would be in, i.e.
"dense" or "sparse".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}

\item{sparsity}{The proportion of sparsity of the matrix if
\code{representation="sparse"}}

\item{type}{"double" or "int"; the storage type of the data matrix.  If you
don't know the type, it is probably stored as a double, so the default value
will suffice.}

\item{intsize}{The size (in bytes) of an integer.  Default is 4, but this is
platform dependent.}

\item{names}{string; control for whether the unit names should be
printed out or their abbreviation should be used.  Options are "long" and
"short", respectively.  Case is ignored.}
}
\value{
A numeric pair, the dimensions of a matrix.
}
\description{
How many rows/columns of a matrix can be stored for a given memory size.
}
\details{
This function provides the maximum dimension of an unallocated, dense,
in-core, numeric matrix of known byte size. For example, it will show the
largest possible square matrix which is 16 GiB (46340x46340).

If the both \code{nrow} and \code{ncol} are missing (blank inputs), then the
largest square matrix will be returned.  If one of \code{nrow} or
\code{ncol} is supplied and the other is missing, then the non-supplied
argument (\code{nrow} or \code{ncol}) will be determined according to the
supplied one.  If both arguments are supplied, an error is produced --- you
probably meant to use \code{howmany()}.

If \code{out.type="approximate"}, then a reduced representation of the
dimensions will be returned.  For example, the reduced representation of the
number 1234567890 would be "1.2b", since this number is basically 1.2
billion.  Not super useful, but kind of cute, and it arguably enhances
readability when fishing for a ballpark figure.
